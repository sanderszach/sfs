This was my typical day. Wake up, scroll through social media and the news while in bed “waking up my eyes”, exercise, get ready for the day, and open up my laptop for a 9-hour day as a Software Engineer. My only interruptions being filled with additional swiping, scrolling, and streaming of videos. When I got off work, I would “rest my brain” and space out for a few minutes (more scrolling). I would have dinner with my wife and we would watch an episode or two of our latest show. And as I went to bed, I would “make my eyes tired” with some more checking of social media and the news.

When I looked around, my behavior seemed normal. This is just what everyone does now. I wasn’t using screens more than anyone else. But why did I feel like I was addicted?

That’s when I sat down with my wife, and we decided we needed to make a change. We wanted our time back, and we wanted to enjoy the real world.

So here’s what we did. We decided no screens on Saturday. It’s just one day a week, it has clear boundaries, and it feels manageable.

The first time we did it, we immediately knew this was an idea worth pursuing. It felt like being on vacation. We enjoyed the outdoors. We read. We cooked. We saw friends. And come Sunday, we were relaxed and renewed.

So that’s it. And now we want others to know our secret and try it out with us!
